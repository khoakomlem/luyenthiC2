            - **Content:** Did the writer accurately summarize the key points from both texts? Did they evaluate the abstract arguments and effectively integrate their own ideas? Is the target reader fully informed?
            - **Communicative Achievement:** Are the conventions of a discursive essay used with complete command? Are complex ideas communicated in a convincing and effective way?
            - **Organisation:** Is the text impressively and coherently organised? Is there a wide range of cohesive devices and organizational patterns used with complete flexibility?
            - **Language:** Is there a wide and sophisticated range of vocabulary and grammatical structures, used with precision and style? Are any inaccuracies only minor slips?
            Provide a score from 1-5 for each subscale and detailed, constructive feedback with specific examples from the text.

            - **Communicative Achievement:** Does the article use an appropriate style and tone (e.g., engaging, personal, humorous) to hold the reader's attention with ease? Are genre conventions like a title and direct/indirect speech used effectively?
            - **Organisation:** Is the text well-organised and coherent? Does it use varied organisational patterns to lead the reader through the topic naturally?
            - **Language:** Is a wide range of vocabulary, including natural turns of phrase and collocations, used with style? Is grammar sophisticated and well-controlled?

            - **Language:** Is a range of topic-specific and evaluative vocabulary used effectively and precisely? Is there a wide range of grammatical forms used with full control?
